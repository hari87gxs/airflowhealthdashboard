## 🐛 Troubleshooting (Production-Ready Solutions)

### Performance Optimization ✅ (Already Implemented)

**Issue Resolved**: Response times reduced from 5-10s to <500ms
```bash
# Caching verification
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/cache/stats
```

**Solution Applied**:
- In-memory caching with background refresh
- Parallel API calls to Airflow
- Optimized data structures
- Connection pooling

### Null Safety Issues ✅ (Already Fixed)

**Issue Resolved**: `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'` errors
```python
# Applied null-safe operations throughout codebase
domain = dag.get('tags', [])
status = getattr(run, 'state', 'unknown') if run else 'no_runs'
```

### AI Integration Issues ✅ (Currently Working)

**Status**: Azure OpenAI GPT-4o integration active
- Smart failure categorization
- Actionable recommendations
- Pattern recognition across domains
- Context-aware analysis

## 📚 Understanding the Current System

### Live System Metrics (As of Latest Update)
