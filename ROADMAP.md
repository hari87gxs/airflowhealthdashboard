## Known Limitations

Current limitations to address in future versions:
1. No task-level details (by design for v1.0)
2. Limited to tags for domain grouping
3. No alerting/notification system
4. No historical trend storage
5. Single Airflow instance only
6. No user customization

## Research & Exploration

Areas for future investigation:
- GraphQL API alternative
- Real-time updates via Server-Sent Events
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- AI-powered insights and recommendations
- Integration with DataDog, Grafana, etc.
- Custom metric collection
